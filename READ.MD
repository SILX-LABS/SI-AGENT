# SI-AGENT â€” Text-to-API Platform

SI-AGENT is an AI-powered platform that transforms plain language instructions into fully functional backend APIs.  
Unlike most AI tools that focus on frontend generation, SI-AGENT is designed to automate backend infrastructure, data engineering, and system design.  
The goal is to make backend development accessible to anyone without requiring manual coding or infrastructure knowledge.

## Overview

A user gives SI-AGENT a natural language instruction such as:  
"Create an API that analyzes the picture of $image."  

SI-AGENT interprets this request like a senior backend engineer.  
It understands the technical requirements, generates the project structure, and builds the backend automatically.  
This includes choosing the right frameworks, generating routes, setting up authentication, integrating models, and deploying to the cloud.

## How SI-AGENT Works

The process starts with a plain language prompt.  
The system breaks it down into required components.  
It detects whether machine learning, authentication, data storage, or third-party integration is needed.  
If a model is required, it prompts the user to upload data or automatically pulls a suitable one from open-source repositories.  
It selects the appropriate framework, such as FastAPI, NestJS, or Express.  
It then generates the directory structure, routes, controllers, services, and testing environment.  
Finally, SI-AGENT deploys the generated backend and returns a live API URL ready to use.

## Tech Stack

The frontend is built using Next.js with the App Router.  
The backend uses Node.js with either Express or NestJS.  
The AI core runs the Text-to-API generation engine.  
The database layer supports PostgreSQL or MongoDB.  
The deployment uses a cloud-native, containerized architecture.

## Why SI-AGENT is Different

SI-AGENT focuses entirely on backend automation.  
It builds production-ready infrastructure, not just prototypes.  
It handles routing, authentication, deployment, and model integration.  
It is designed for developers, startups, and enterprises that want to build fast without large backend teams.

## Example Use Case

A user types:  
"Build an API that classifies uploaded product images and returns the category."

SI-AGENT detects that this is an image classification task.  
It selects or requests an appropriate model.  
It creates routes such as /upload and /classify.  
It sets up authentication and database storage.  
It then deploys and provides a live endpoint URL.

## Market Vision

The text-to-API domain represents the next wave of software automation.  
Most competitors currently focus on frontend generation, leaving backend engineering underserved.  
SI-AGENT targets the $70 billion developer tooling and AI engineering market by automating backend infrastructure at scale.

## Roadmap

Initial MVP focuses on core text-to-API generation.  
Later stages will introduce automated deployment, integrations, multi-agent development workflows, and a marketplace for generated APIs.  
The long-term vision is to fully automate backend engineering.

## Contributing

Clone the repository.  
Install dependencies.  
Run the Next.js frontend.  
Connect to the backend boilerplate.  
Start building on top of the generated structure.

## Vision Statement

We are building a world where backend engineering happens at the speed of thought.
